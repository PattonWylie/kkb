		<h3 id="AboutHeader">About Us</h3>
		<p id="AboutBody">Kero Kero Bonito is a British band known for their eclectic and genre-blending sound, which mixes elements of J-pop, indie pop, electronic,<br> and even hip-hop. Formed in London in 2013, the group consists of Sarah Bonito (vocals), Gus Lobban (production), and Jamie Bulled (drums).<br> Their music is often characterized by upbeat, playful melodies, catchy hooks, and a sense of quirky fun. Kero Kero Bonito gained recognition<br> with their debut album Bonito Generation (2016), featuring a vibrant, experimental sound that resonated with fans of alternative pop. They<br> have continued to evolve their style, embracing more experimental electronic textures and introspective themes in later works like Time ‘n’ <br>Place (2018) and Civilisation II (2021). Their unique fusion of sounds and cultural influences has earned them a dedicated global following.</p>
